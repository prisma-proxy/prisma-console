# Prisma Console

Real-time web console for monitoring and managing the [Prisma](https://github.com/prisma-proxy/prisma) proxy server. Built as a static site and served directly by the Prisma server.

## Build

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
```

Static files are output to `out/`. Configure the server to serve them:

```toml
[management_api]
enabled = true
listen_addr = "127.0.0.1:9090"
auth_token = "your-secure-token-here"
console_dir = "./apps/prisma-console/out"
```

Then access the console at `http://127.0.0.1:9090/`. Log in using the `auth_token` from your server config.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:3000
```

During development, the console connects to the management API on the same origin. Start the Prisma server with the management API enabled and configure `cors_origins` if running the dev server on a different port.
